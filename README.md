# HTML Game Template

## This is a game "template" I coded using HTML and JS. It is not necessarily a game, it is some sort of template. so I could avoid hardcoding and make some silly games out of its logic very easily. One of the best HTML game tests I've made so far.

*Note: I made this just for fun, but I might make a documentation on how it works, just for practicing purposes, so I can learn how to organize my projects better*
